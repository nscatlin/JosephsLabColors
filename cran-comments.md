In version 0.3.5 I have updated some issues with mismatched palette names and also added a couple of new palettes. There were issues with reverse dependency checks in 3 packages.
- CompetingRisk
- npregfast
- repurrsive

All three had warnings only on PDF version of the manual. I will continue to monitor these warnings and file issues or pull requests to the respective packages if problems arise.
